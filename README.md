## 💡 Example — One Solved DDL Query  

### 🧾 Task: Create a `students` table  
**Goal:** Store student details including ID, Name, and Marks.  

```sql
CREATE DATABASE my_uni;

USE my_uni;

CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    student_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    course VARCHAR(30),
    marks INT CHECK (marks >= 0 AND marks <= 100)
);
✅ Explanation:

PRIMARY KEY → ensures each student has a unique ID

AUTO_INCREMENT → automatically assigns the next ID

CHECK → validates marks are between 0–100

📚 Practice Exercise
Try it yourself 👇

Create a departments table with dept_id, dept_name, and location.
Add a UNIQUE constraint to dept_name and ensure location is not null.

Save your answer as departments_table.sql inside /Practice.
